# Step Back

Okay, we just focused super hard on implementing that code. Now, I want to pause for breath for a moment and think about how this fits into the study of digital literature.

In our class, we've thought a good deal about using computers to analyze text and understand the patterns within it. These patterns have often been something that's inseparable from the author who created it like their writing style or their favorite words. We've used this data to extrapolate further, into the identities of writers and their relationships to the world around them.

Steganography seems like a far cry from that, because its hidden meaning doesn't show up as trends in the text the same way. The secret message is deliberately obscured from the casual reader rather than accidentally, which creates a large perceptual difference. However, I think there's more in common here than it seems. In particular, the abstract idea of "finding patterns" is important to both. This is especially true for more sophisticated steganography algorithms, but even in this toy example someone outside of the intended audience could figure out the code through pattern-finding and noticing the odd spacing.

However, many of the text analysis methods we've learned this semester would also immediately strip the spacing from the text and remove any chance of finding the secret. This problem is not one that only occurs for steganography, it is fundamental to the idea of analyzing a text. Everything comes down to what we choose to look for, and what we choose not to or forget about.
