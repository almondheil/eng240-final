# Welcome!

Hello! Welcome to the tutorial I made on *space steganography*.
This project was completed as part of Professor Erik Simpson's
[Lighting the Page](https://eriksimpson.sites.grinnell.edu/Connections/Digital/Lighting/index.html)
course in Spring 2025.

Here are some questions I anticipate you might have as a reader (click to expand):

??? question "What is the goal of this tutorial?"

    I have 2 goals (because I have 2 motivations too)

    1. **Show** how steganography fits into the landscape of digital literature.
    2. **Make** something to explore those ideas in a hands on way, so it's not just passive.

??? question "Who's the audience? Do I need to know Python?"

    No, you don't need to know very much Python.

    I wrote this tutorial thinking about the other students in Lighting the Page.
    There are a lot of different levels of comfort with Python in that classroom, which is valuable.

    I'll assume you have a general idea of how python works
    (that functions and variables are things that exist, for instance),
    but I'll take time to explain the things we didn't cover as much in class.
    That may take the form of more expandable boxes like this one.

Once you're ready, [let's get started](what-is-steg.md)!
